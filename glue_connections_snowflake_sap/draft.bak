# Introduction

This article provides a step-by-step guide for setting up your glue jobs and connection to be able to connect to Snowflake and SAP HANA databases.
This guide also helps you to establish process for other JDBC sources.
This article provides sample CloudFormation code for creating resources alongside with sample jobs for testing.
This article also shows best practices on setting up Glue Connections, so credentials are stored in Secrets Manager rather than in Connection itself.

# General Steps to setup up Glue to work with JDBC sources such as Snowflake, SAP HANA

Here we describe general overview of steps. Code specific

Prerequisite - you'll need S3 bucket to store glue jobs scripts and artifacts (such as jdbc drivers).

- Step1. Create a secret in Secrets Manager storing your credentials
- Step2. Download JDBC driver and put it into Glue S3 bucket
- Step2. Create a Glue Connection 
    - provide a proper JDBC string 
    - reference JDBC driver location on S3
    - reference previously created secret

Testing:
- Step4. Create a Glue job (sample code is in "glue" folder)
- Step5. Run the glue Jobs to test connectivity

## Prerequisites

In this step we create a bucket where we place the sample glue job scripts and JDBC drivers.
```bash
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name cf-awshowto-glueconn-010-s3 \
    --template-body file://cloudformation/010_s3.yaml
```
