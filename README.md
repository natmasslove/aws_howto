# Intro

This project provides a collection of helpful tips and tricks for working with AWS.  
Each "how-to" includes practical code examples, CloudFormation templates, and Bash scripts that can help simplify the deployment process.

# How-To List:

This section includes articles describing solution to the problems which I think either not very well documented (at the moment when I wrote the article ðŸ˜ƒ ) or require excessive amount of experimentation to make things work.  

Here I wanted to provide solutions which you can easily take and adjust for your needs with minimal efforts.

* [How to setup and use connections and variables in AWS managed Apache Airflow](mwaa_connections_and_vars/README.md)
* [How to accelerate your Glue Job development with Glue Interactive Sessions](glue_interactive_sessions/README.md)

# Getting-Hands-Dirty section:

Here I put small "projects" where I either explore new functionalities or create snippets to be re-used by "future myself" (or anyone else, of course ðŸ˜ƒ )
