Intro:

AWS provides a wide set of serverless technologies.
Glue & EMR - for big data processing (specifically EMR serverless, as we are talking serverless)


Criteria:

+++ add ideas from Gmail

* EMR - no Dynamic Data Frame
* EMR - no bookmarks?
* EMR - start Up time (pre-initialized workers cost extra)

* Glue - min = 2 DPU ($0.8) = 4 vCPU + 16Gb
  for EMR Serverless (check?) - min 1vCPU = $0.05, 1GB RAM = $0.005



Conclusion:

??? Scenarios where EMR Serverless fits the best:
- you have existing Big Data workloads hosted on EMR cluster and you want to move to Serverless
- you want to use not only Spark, but, for example Hive - but if Hive - take a look at running in inside Athena
- (??? need to test) - smaller workloads which doesn't need to use 2 DPU (i.e. 8 vCPUs)
